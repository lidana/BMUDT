function model = HDDT(features,labels,model,numBins,cutoff,memThresh,memSplit)
%Function: HDDT
%Form: model = HDDT(features,labels,model,numBins,cutoff,memThresh,memSplit)
%Description: Recursively build Hellinger Distance Decision Tree
%Parameters:
%   features: I X F numeric matrix where I is the number of instances and F
%       is the number of features. Each row represents one training instance
%       and each column represents the value of one of its corresponding features
%   labels: I x 1 numeric matrix where I is the number of instances. Each
%       row is the label of a specific training instance and corresponds to
%       the same row in features
%   numBins: Number of bins for discretizing numeric features.
%   cutoff: Number representing maximum number of instances in a
%       leaf node.
%   memSplit: If features matrix is large, compute discretization splits
%       iteratively in batches of size memSplit instead all at once.
%   memThresh: If features matrix is large, compute discretization splits
%       iteratively in batches of size memSplit only if number of instances
%       in branch is greater than memThresh.
%Output:
%   model: a Hellinger Distance Decision Subtree model
